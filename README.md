## Challenge Question

How might we use creativity and technology to address gender diversity in CS/SE?

Creativity and play are critical to early learning. However, they are often overlooked as we continue through education and employment. Our ability create and innovate are key to facing an uncertain future and solving challenging problems. One such problem is gender diversity in STEM, women and genderqueer people remain underrepresented in computer science and software engineering.

We are seeking solutions that embed creativity and technology to address gender diversity in CS/SE, from raising awareness and cultivating interest to facilitating systemic change. Consider the challenges and contributing factors to the gender gap in CS and SE from early education to the upper echelons of industry and academia. This is a complex problem, determine where you want to focus your solution and start innovating.
